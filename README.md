About Me ðŸ˜ƒ

I am an ambitious, self-motivated  and organised person, dedicated to learning new skills and solving problems. I am especially interested in developing technology which helps people solve the challenges they face. I am experienced at working in, and leading, teams to deliver on objectives using the skills that I have developed from my previous role as a Biomedical Scientist and my time at the School of Code, such as; communication, teamworking, leadership, adaptability, and flexibility. I am now looking to join a company to solve problems and create meaningful technology for the world. 

When I'm not coding and learning new skills, I enjoy playing games with my young son, baking a new dessert once a week and cooking new dishes. 
I've always enjoyed art from a young age and am a self taught oil and acrylic on canvas painter. Other interests include reading books and travelling.
